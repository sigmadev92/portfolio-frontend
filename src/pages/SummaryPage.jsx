        <strong>Devansh Raghuwanshi</strong>. <br /> <br />I completed my school
        education at <i>Delhi Public School Vijaypur in 2019 </i>
        in <b>science Stream</b>. <br />
        My interest developed to solve complex mathematical problems and I
        decided to study science in depth and took admission in{" "}
        <strong>
          <span className="text-red-500">BSc H Mathematics</span> at{" "}

          in <u>2019</u>.

        That was the best decision of my life as I learnt and understood so many
        things. Though I was a student of Mathematics but stil the University
        provided me with all possible disciplines like Computer Science,
        Mechanics and Physics.
        <br />
        Till my final year, I gained experience in many technologies of computer
        science like making websites and working on different languages like
        Python, C++, Matlab etc. Also they taught me essential concepts like DSA
        and DBMS
        <br />
        I graduated in 2022 and for 2 years I experimented and learned so many
        things like multimedia editing, 3d modelling and animations. I prepared
        for exams like SBI PO, SSC CGL and MPPSC. Unfortunately I couldn't crack
        those exams but gained much knowledge in solving aptitude and GS
        questions. I later taught many students Quants and Reasoning.
        <br />
        Now from Feb 2025 onwards, I decided to continue my career in Software
        development field. I have made web Apps, desktop apps, animations and 3d
        modelling and have a keen interest in Data Science as well.
