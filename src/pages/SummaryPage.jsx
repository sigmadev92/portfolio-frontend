        That was the best decision of my life as I learnt and understood so many
        things. Though I was a student of Mathematics but stil the University
        provided me with all possible disciplines like Computer Science,
        Mechanics and Physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Till my final year, I gained experience in many technologies of computer
        science like making websites and working on different languages like
        Python, C++, Matlab etc. Also they taught me essential concepts like DSA
        and DBMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated in 2022 and for 2 years I experimented and learned so many
        things like multimedia editing, 3d modelling and animations. I prepared
        for exams like SBI PO, SSC CGL and MPPSC. Unfortunately I couldn't crack
        those exams but gained much knowledge in solving aptitude and GS
        questions. I later taught many students Quants and Reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now from Feb 2025 onwards, I decided to continue my career in Software
        development field. I have made web Apps, desktop apps, animations and 3d
        modelling and have a keen interest in Data Science as well.
